for Consecutive elements
from base location to last elements location(size-1)
     -access address+(location*size of each element)



for Linked list

   from first location:
      -defference to reach the element,access it
      -Now ,read the address of next element
      -if next pointer is nullptr,break
      -else,repeat steps

universal algorithm
1.for every element fetched from the container
    (Dont give a damn how you get it),
     -access the element and do something with it

Class ENgine should have the following attributes
   - engine_id of type string
   - engine_type which could be HYBRID ICE or ALTERNATE_FUEL
   - engine_cc which is float value
   - engine_torque which is a float value
   - engine_horsepower which is an int value
Create the following functionalities in functionalities.cpp
 
1 Create 5 objects of the class Engine on the heap. Attach a shared_ptr
to each object created and emplace thess shared_Ptr into a list container
 
2 A function to return a container of shred_ptr pointing to theobjects
which satisfy the predicate condition passed
 
Hint :Accept a predicate,apply it in data container,identify objects that predicate 
condiiton and return a container of pointers to the such objects
 
3 A functional to find and return if atleaste one object meet a predicate 
condition passed
 
4 A function to find the average engine_cc and return the value
